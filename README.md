# Distributed Algorithms
* Assignment responses including .tex and .pdf file are located in assignment0X/Document
* Please set your teachnet.path prior to attempting to use any of the shell scripts (e.g. runEcho.sh).

## How to prepare your submission:
===============================
a) Implement the given exercises

b) Make sure your java-files are compilable

c) Make sure you have the correct configurations

d) Make sure your run scripts are working

e) Properly structure your submission:


## Template Layout
+ teachnet.path
  + flooding
    + run.sh
	+ myconfig.txt
	+ Flooding.java
	+ *.java
  + echo
	+ run.sh
	+ myconfig.txt
	+ Echo.java
	+ *.java

f) Keep naming conventions in mind:
Either use "run.sh" or "runXXX.sh"

g) Keep it simple!
You can use packages, but usually it is not
necessary. However, if your run scripts
are not working I consider your submission
as not working!


## What should be part of the submission
=====================================
a) the run script (run.sh)
b) the configuration file (myconfig.txt)
c) the teachnet path file (teachnet.path)
