\section*{Exercise 3.1: Distributed Garbage Collection}
  \subsection*{a)} % Automaticgarbagecollectionsimplifiestheprogrammingofdistributedapplications.Investigatehow the distributed garbage collection is achieved in CORBA, Microsoft DCOM, Java RMI, and .Net Remoting and make a short comparision between these approaches.
  \subsection*{b)} % The Weighted Reference Counting algorithm applying the credit method has been introduced in the lecture. Implement that algorithm using the simulation framework. Choose a node which creates a local object that shall be accessed remotely. Now, implement a behavior such that in (random) time intervals (randomly) chosen nodes request a reference to the remote object and meanwhile some nodes discard their reference. Finally, discard all references at the end of the simulation such that the created object can be garbage collected.
  \subsection*{c)} % A drawback of mark and sweep is the freezing of the system. This approach has a bad impact on both, the distributed as well as the non-distributed (multiple threads running on the same machine) case. There are approaches that aim not to freeze the system permanently during the garbage collection in order to maintain performance. How can this be achieved?
